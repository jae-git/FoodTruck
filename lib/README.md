## Why ORG.JSON ?  

I have considered Jackson (Maven), Google GSON (Maven), and Org.JSON (Maven). Among the JSON libraries, ORG.JSON was the lightest one.  Jackson is considered to have the best performance among the popular JSON libraries.

## Where to download ORG.JSON

The original download is available at https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json <br/>
The github for ORG.JSON https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java  <br/>
