# FoodTruck
This is a very simple command-line program that will print out a list of food trucks, given a source of food truck data from the San Francisco governmentâ€™s API.

## Dependency

Java version used : openjdk version "1.8.0_252"

A very small JSON library ORG.JSON was used. It is included in '/lib' folder. [For more information, please the document here](lib/README.md)

## Build

Firstly, git clone the project. <br/>
Once git cloned, just compile with the following command
```
javac -cp ".:./lib/json-20200518.jar" src/*.java
```

## Run 

```
java -cp ".:./lib/json-20200518.jar:./src" FoodTruckFinder
```

## Design considerations

The main program "FoodTruckFinder" has two different implementations.  The first one calls Socrata API for each pagination.  
```
	DirectAPICallPresenter presenter = new DirectAPICallPresenter();

	presenter.interactivePresentation();
```

The second one executes the query for all the food truck for the day and keeps the results in memory. The result dataset is less than 1MB in size. Given the small size of the dataset, it can be kept in memory. If the program is to be used as a backend service, the cache needs to be refreshed on a daily base. Also, Socrata API is rate limited. For scalability and latency purpose, keeping query result in memory makes more sense. 

```
	CachedPresenter presenter = new CachedPresenter();

	presenter.interactivePresentation();

```
